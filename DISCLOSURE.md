# Disclosure Framework

This document clarifies the nature of content across the Phyllux ecosystem and establishes consistent disclosure practices.

## Maturity Levels

Content in the Phyllux ecosystem is categorized by maturity level:

### Conceptual
- Early-stage ideas
- Theoretical frameworks
- Exploratory concepts
- Not yet reduced to practice

### Derived
- Concepts derived from existing work
- Extensions or variations of known approaches
- Clear lineage to prior art

### Simulated
- Concepts validated through simulation
- Computational models
- Not yet physically realized
- Performance estimates based on models

### Structural
- Physical or logical structures defined
- Implementation approaches specified
- May include prototypes or partial implementations

### Candidate for Formalization
- Ready for provisional patent application (PPA)
- Sufficiently detailed for formal filing
- May be in process of formalization

## Image Roles

Images serve different purposes and should be labeled accordingly:

### Concept Art
- Illustrative representations
- Not necessarily accurate to final implementation
- Used for communication and visualization

### Placeholder
- Temporary visual representation
- Will be replaced with final content
- Indicates where content will appear

### Structural Diagram
- Technical representation
- Shows relationships, connections, or architecture
- Intended to be accurate to design

### Reproducible Figure
- Generated from scripts or code
- Can be regenerated from source
- Part of reproducible research workflow

## Public Disclosure Intent

Content in public Phyllux repositories is shared as **openly shared research concepts and methods**. This means:

- Concepts and methods are publicly disclosed
- No guarantees are provided about performance, feasibility, or commercial viability
- Content is shared to enable research, collaboration, and prior art establishment
- Formal embodiments may be described separately in provisional or technical filings

## Performance Claims

**No performance claims are made unless:**
- Explicitly measured and cited
- Clearly labeled as simulation results
- Properly qualified with uncertainty ranges
- Supported by reproducible methods

**Language to use:**
- "Simulations suggest..."
- "Preliminary results indicate..."
- "Theoretical analysis shows..."
- "Exploratory work aims to..."

**Language to avoid:**
- "Guaranteed performance"
- "Proven to achieve..."
- "Demonstrated results" (unless actually demonstrated)
- Unqualified performance numbers

## Relationship to Formal Filings

Public disclosure in repositories:
- Establishes prior art
- Enables research collaboration
- Supports open innovation

Formal filings (provisional patents, utility patents):
- May contain additional detail
- May refine claims based on further work
- Are separate from public repository content

**Repositories support formal filings but do not compete with them.**

## Quantum Resistance and Security Claims

When discussing cryptographic or security properties:

- Use exploratory language: "explores quantum resistance" rather than "is quantum-resistant"
- Qualify theoretical claims: "aims to provide" rather than "provides"
- Reference research status: "research-stage" or "theoretical framework"
- Avoid absolute security guarantees

## Medical and Implant Implications

Content related to medical devices or implants:
- Must include appropriate disclaimers
- Must note regulatory requirements (FDA, etc.)
- Must clarify research-stage status
- Must avoid medical advice or treatment claims

## Gift Language Clarification

When content is described as a "gift" or "no strings attached":
- This means concepts and methods are openly shared
- Research use is encouraged
- Commercial use may require licensing (see 4-tier model)
- Attribution is appreciated but not always required (varies by tier)

**Preferred phrasing:** "Openly shared research concepts and methods"

---

**This framework applies across all Phyllux repositories. Individual repositories may have additional disclosure requirements.**
