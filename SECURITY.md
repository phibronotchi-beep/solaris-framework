# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Phyllux Framework is actively maintained. Security updates are applied to the current version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Phyllux Framework:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email: phibronotchi@gmail.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Response Time

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment within 7 days.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The Phyllux Framework repository itself
- Templates and documentation
- Scripts and automation tools

**Note:** This policy does not cover vulnerabilities in inventions created using the framework. Those should be reported to the respective inventors.

## What We're Looking For

- Security issues in scripts or automation
- Vulnerabilities in documentation that could mislead users
- Issues with template files that could cause legal problems
- Problems with cross-repository references

## What's Out of Scope

- Issues with inventions created using the framework (contact the inventor)
- General questions about IP protection (use GitHub Discussions)
- Feature requests (use GitHub Issues)
