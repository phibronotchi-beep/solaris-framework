## ABSTRACT (50-150 words)

Brief summary of what your invention is and what problem it solves.

**Example:**
"Phyllux Mesh is a brain-computer interface electrode array that uses phyllotactic patterns and the golden angle (137.508°) to optimize electrode spacing. Unlike conventional grid arrays, Phyllux Mesh is designed to reduce signal crosstalk, improve signal quality, and minimize tissue damage through biomimetic spacing. The design is scalable from 32 to 10,000+ electrodes and manufacturable using existing photolithography techniques."

**Your abstract:**
[Write 2-4 sentences describing your invention, its key advantage, and primary application]

## BACKGROUND

### Problem Being Solved
Describe the current problem or limitation your invention addresses.

**Example:**
"Current brain-computer interface electrodes use grid-based arrays that suffer from high crosstalk between adjacent electrodes, poor signal-to-noise ratios, and tissue damage from non-optimal spacing patterns. These limitations restrict BCI resolution and long-term biocompatibility."

**Your problem:**
[What problem does your invention solve? What are the limitations of existing solutions?]

### Prior Art & Existing Solutions
What currently exists in this space? How is your invention different/better?

**Example:**
"Existing electrode arrays include: Michigan arrays (grid-based, fixed spacing), Utah arrays (3D grid, high density but high damage), flexible polymer arrays (grid-based, better biocompatibility but still suboptimal spacing)."

**Existing solutions:**
[List 2-4 current approaches to this problem. Be factual - this shows you understand the field.]
